<b>Color and Description Disclaimer</b>
<p>
I at Mili's do my best to present the products on my website/page as they appear in original. While great effort has been put to accurately reproduce products in their original style and texture, there may be minor variations from the actual product. Products ordered with sequin and stone decoration often come off even with best and careful handling, so it should be known while placing the order. Few of the fabrics have tendency to reflect textured effects as a proof of their authenticity. This should not be mistaken for a faulty product. Handicraft, hand dyed, items will always have certain minor differences. The raw finish of the handicrafts cannot be compared with machine finished products as this raw finish is the beauty of the handicrafts items. It is practically impossible for us to replicate the same colors on a product as seen on the website or your computer screen. A minor variation in the shade selected by you is considered as a normal practice as these products have a tendency to reflect different shades of a color under different light and weather, type of camera used for photography or type and settings on the computer monitor. We request you to place an order keeping in mind these minor variations in the product as seen on a computer screen against the product received.
